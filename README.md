# SafeMate
 
The purpose of this project was to develop a useful application with both server and mobile components. The application was required to have information shared between clients, RESTFUL web services + server messaging (in a private repository), and location based services.

SafeMate is an android mobile application that utilizes RESTFUL web services to communicate the live location of all connected clients. User's can successfully track the live location of all their peers, as well as let them know whenever they are safe or require help.
